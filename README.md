Basic OOD(Object Oriented Design)

Application performs the following actions and gives us the basic idea of how OOPs can be used in Java.

1. Generate an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
2. Determine the department (sales, development, accounting), if none leave blank.
3. Generate a random String for a password.
4. Have set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity, and define an alternate
email address.
5. Have get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity.
